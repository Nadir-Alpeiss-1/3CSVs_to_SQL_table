# Welcome to My M And A

## Task
The problem teaches to merge several csv files which are different in terms of formatting. So it was about creating one file consisting of csv files which had to be of the same format as that of the final document. 
Also, it was about importing function from another python with the csv to sql function which was created previously in my babel task. Also, the problem suggest to figure out how to git ignore file if you do not need it to be seen to other users.

## Description
The main steps were to figure out how to merge several csv files, observing them, and comparing it with the final document in order to see whether everything was in place and written correctly. Also, there was some slight changes made to the babel file.

## Installation
In order to check the correctness of the code written one can run gandalf check. The overall result is correct, however every mini test of gandalf is failed due to different ways of solving the problem. I decided to create one "cleaning" function for every csv file since it has its own format.
The gandalf tests are about writing separate functions for almost every column (age, gender, etc.)

## Usage
One can just enter python my_m_and_a.py and see the the lines of sql table and also the header of the sql table. 
Also one can see the file called plastic_free_boutique.sql in the repository which is generated by the code. 

### The Core Team
I have solved the problem by myself since there was noone who was looking for a teammate for this task.
